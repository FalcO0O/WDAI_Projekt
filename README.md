# WDAI_Projekt  

## Project Description  

**WDAI_Projekt** is a web application developed as part of the *Introduction to Web Applications* course. The application allows users to manage their meals, including viewing meal history, calculating calorie needs and BMI, and browsing recipes.  

## Features  

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create accounts and log into the application.  
- **Meal History**: View a history of consumed meals categorized by days.  
- **Admin Panel**: Provides administrators with access to user and content management. (TODO)  

## System Requirements  

- Node.js version 14.x or later  
- npm version 6.x or later  
- SQLite as the database  

## Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FalcO0O/WDAI_Projekt.git
   cd WDAI_Projekt
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  

   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Run the application**  

   ```bash
   npm run start-all
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.  

   Do not confuse this with `npm install` and `npm start`.  
   In our approach, we install all dependencies using scripts and start both the backend and frontend simultaneously.  

## Usage  

After launching the application:  

- **Registration**: Create a new account by providing the required details.  
- **Login**: Sign in using your previously created credentials.  
- **Meal History**: Check your meal consumption history in the designated section.  
- **Admin Panel**: If you are an administrator, you will gain access to the admin panel, where you can manage users and content.
